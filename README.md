# Concordance

This solution was inspired from this repository: https://github.com/andrerpena/WordCounter
Problems with above repository solution: It was unable to handle abbreviations ("i.e.", "e.g.") cases
I have fixed abbreviations case and code is able to produce results correctly which were failing before.
Time Spent: Approx 30 minutes to search on github for solutions, 30 minutes to check and understand current solution, 30 minutes to fix and test my fix and improved version.
Pending Issue: After fix abbreviations are not printed currently. With more time on hand I would like to change design of program in order to handle abbreviations and digits 
Total Time spent: 2 hours
