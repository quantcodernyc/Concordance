# Concordance

This solution was inspired from this repository: https://github.com/andrerpena/WordCounter

Problems with above repository solution: It was unable to handle abbreviations ("i.e.", "e.g.") cases and completely gave wrong index and occurrences results for every word in text.

I have fixed abbreviations issue and now code is able to produce results correctly.

Time Spent: Approx 30 minutes to search on github for solutions, 30 minutes to check and understand current solution, 30 minutes to fix and test my fix and improved version.

Pending Issue: After I fixed abbreviations issue, all words are printed correctly except abbreviations are printed as one character. For example, "e.g." print as "e" & "i.e." print as "i". In order to fix this issue need certain program design changes and I anticipate 2 to 3 hours to fix it. 

Total Time spent: 2 hours
